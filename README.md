# OodleUE

Despite being one of the best compression libraries out there, Oodle is notoriously difficult to obtain. This repository is updated daily with the latest Oodle builds for Unreal Engine.

**By using these assets, you agree to the [Unreal Engine EULA](https://www.unrealengine.com/eula/unreal). I take zero ownership of any code or build artifacts that are retrieved from Epic's servers and Git repository.**

This repository is available to allow for easy installation of Oodle for those who don't have Unreal Engine constantly kept up to date. It also theoretically allows package managers to be able to provide Oodle to its end users. However, considering that Oodle is not my IP, I believe that there is a non-zero chance that someone at Epic Games or RAD doesn't want this repository to be publicly available. If that is indeed the case, simply contact me and I can take down this repository and/or work with you to find a viable solution.
