    It is described by the number of channels, then the format of each channel.
    For example, `OodleTex_PixelFormat_2_U16` is 32-bits per pixel, two 16-bit components, unsigned.

    Multi-channel pixels listed in memory order and values are assumed to be normalized,
    eg. `OodleTex_PixelFormat_4_U8_RGBA` is like `DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM`, and `OodleTex_PixelFormat_2_S16`
    corresponds to `DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16_SNORM`.
    
    The pixel formats are treated as normalized (UNORM or SNORM) in the D3D convention.  Opaque alpha is 255, 65535,
    or 1.0, depending on format.
    
    Float formats like `OodleTex_PixelFormat_4_F32_RGBA` can only be used with BC6 output.  (The BC6 encoder requires
    float input).
    
    BC4S and BC5S (SNORM) can only be encoded from signed integer pixel formats (S8 or S16), all other formats will refuse
    to read signed integer pixels.  
    
    The formats 1_F32 and 2_F32 cannot be directly encoded to BC4/5 but can be converted to S16 or U16 with
    $OodleTex_BlitNormalized before encoding.  They are included for convenience.

    Formats without alpha act like they have an implicit opaque alpha channel (255 for `OodleTex_PixelFormat_3_U8_RGB`
    and 1.0 for `OodleTex_PixelFormat_3_F32_RGB`).  However, 3 channel RGB behaves differently than 4 channel RGBA with
    opaque alpha in the RMSE call - with 3 channel it is assumed that "ignore alpha" was intended if not explicitly specified.
    Similarly for the RGBx and BGRx formats: if they are promoted to RGBA, opaque alpha is set, but they are different
    than RGBA in that they imply alpha should be ignored.
    
    Oodle Texture does not need to know if the pixels are SRGB gamma corrected or not.  Float input for BC6H is
    assumed to be HDR linear light (unless BCNFlag_BC6_NonRGBData is specified).

    Lambda of zero you don't care about rate at all, and therefore get maximum quality (baseline BCN with no RDO).

    Lambda of 1 (OodleTex_RDOLagrangeLambda_NearLossless) should almost always be used instead of zero, 
    as it will give you near-lossless quality (relative to baseline) but can sometimes find some nice rate savings.
    In fact you can usually go to lambda 5 or 10 and still have super high quality.  Do not treat lambda=1 as the
    only near lossless option.
    
    Higher lambdas correspond to more rate reduction and lower quality.
    
    Lambda in 10-30 should be very small visual quality loss.
    
    Lambda if 30-60 will have some apparent visual quality loss, but should be acceptable in most cases.
    
    Lambda around 50 is the maximum you should use broadly without manual inspection of the results.
    
    Lambda 50-100 can be used for further rate reduction, but is more unpredictable.  It can give unacceptable
    quality loss on some images, but is okay on others.
    
    Lambda 30 is a good default starting point that will give a good balance of rate reduction and quality.
    
    Lambda is not actually a quality parameter, and it can give different quality levels on different images.
    This is intentional.  Lambda is
    more precisely an exchange rate between the different currencies of "rate" and "distortion".  It tells our
    codec how to value a decision, whether it is a profitable transaction to trade a certain rate improvement
    for some distortion penalty.  Higher lambda makes rate gains (size reduction) more value relative to a
    given distortion penalty.  See $RateDistortionOptimization
    
    Any integer greater than zero can be used for lambda, not just the enumerated values.  For example lambda of 5
    will give results between OodleTex_RDOLagrangeLambda_NearLossless (1) and OodleTex_RDOLagrangeLambda_VeryHighQuality (10).

    This allows you to specify the "D" distortion metric used in the rate-distortion optimization.
    Different distortion metrics will score errors in different ways, which changes the encoding.
    
    Typically you should use the "Perceptual" metric.  The Perceptual metric tries to preserve areas
    where it thinks errors will be very visible to the human eye (such as in smooth gradients).
    Perceptual tries to put more error where it thinks it will be hidden to the human eye, such as in
    noisy or highly textured areas.
    
    Perceptual is usually best on regular images, diffuse or albedo textures, or anything that will be
    just looked at by the human eye without reintrepetation of the values.

    The "RMSE" metric simply tries to minimize the squared error of all the channels.  This can be useful
    when the textures channels contain scalar fields which are not really an image.  This is an option
    when Perceptual gives undesirable results.
    
    Note that when measuring codec performance using RMSE or related metrics such as PSNR, you should use
    the RMSE metric, so that the codec is targeting the same goal you are measuring it by.

    Default = Perceptual.

    The difference between RGBA_Perceptual and RGB_A_Perceptual is whether the color and alpha channels
    are treated separately or joint for purposes of visual masking.  This only applies to BC3 and BC7 images
    with alpha channels, in other cases they behave the same.  When relevant, it determines whether noise in
    color/alpha can mask the other.  If A is storing a material property that should be treated separatey for
    color, usually separating them by using RGB_A will be better.

/* Enables universal tiling, when desired.

    Many platforms, especially game consoles, expose GPU-specific native image layouts that employ some kind
    of texture tiling scheme. This can be targeted directly via $OodleTex_Layout, but this means that multi-platform
    projects need to potentially do separate RDO texture encodes for every target.

    The primary effect of native texture layouts as far as Oodle Texture is concerned is that large textures
    usually end up being stored as a sequence of large rectangular 2D tiles, instead of scanline by scanline.
    There is also reordering within those tiles but the effect on RDO encodes and compression performance is
    relatively minor.

    Universal tiling is a compromise: Oodle Texture internally processes a texture as individual tiles of the given
    size. For example, 256KB universal tiling for BC7 textures treats a 2D square of 128x128 blocks as a unit.
    However, both the input and output surfaces passed to Oodle Texture are still in the usual linear, row-major
    order.

    These textures can then be transformed into a number of platform-specific native orders and will in general
    result in noticeably higher compression than if the texture had been encoded in the default linear order,
    although generally somewhat worse than if the actual native $OodleTex_Layout had been used. Linear textures
    using Universal Tiling will on average compress somewhat worse than regular linear layout textures on platforms
    that store assets this way (e.g. PC or Mac), but not by much.

    This makes it possible to cache a single RDO encode in universal tiling order and share the results between
    multiple targets with different native texture tiling schemes, at a considerably saving in overall encode time.

    In general, we've found 256KB block size to give the best overall trade-off across platforms, provided that
    compression is done on independent chunks that are 256KB or larger (uncompressed). If you are paging and
    decompressing data in smaller units, consider using the 64KB variant instead. See "$OodleTex_About_UniversalTiling"
    in the "About" section of the documentation for more information.

/* Detailed RDO encoding options for use with OodleTex_EncodeBCN_RDO_Ex.

    Initializing with = { } (zero-init) gives defaults for everything.

    _effort_ controls RDO encode effort. Lower-effort encodes are faster but produce slightly worse quality
    and compression ratio. The default is to use "High" effort level. "Normal" effort level typically reduces
    RDO encode time by an average factor of around 1.5 to 2 relative to "High". "Low" is faster by the same amount
    and reduces quality further. All three levels are meant to still give good quality; our recommendation is to
    use "Normal" or "Low" during iteration and day-to-day work and reserve "High" levels for shipping builds and
    overnight jobs.

    _metric_ chooses the error metric the encoder targets during RD optimization, one of $OodleTex_RDO_ErrorMetric.
    Typically $OodleTex_RDO_ErrorMetric_Default.

    _bcn_flags_ enables format-specific BCn encoding options as per $OodleTex_BCNFlags.

    _universal_tiling_ enables universal tiling mode; see $OodleTex_RDO_UniversalTiling for a short description
    and "$OodleTex_About_UniversalTiling" for more details.

    _rdo_flags_ is intended for future extension to allow us to add flags controlling RDO encoder operation.
    For now, none are defined; pass OodleTex_RDO_Flags_None.

    _use_bc3_alpha_lambda_ and _bc3_alpha_lambda_: when use_bc3_alpha_lambda is false (default), the argument lambda
    passed to $OodleTex_EncodeBCN_RDO_Ex is used for both RGB and A channels.
    When use_bc3_alpha_lambda is true, the lambda argument is used for the RGB channels and
    bc3_alpha_lambda is used for the A channel. RDO on the BC3 alpha channel can be disabled
    entirely by setting use_bc3_alpha_lambda=true, bc3_alpha_lambda=0. These options
    currently only apply to BC3.

    _not_yet_used_zero_me_ is room for future extensions and currently ignored. Initialize to 0.

typedef struct OodleTex_Layout OodleTex_Layout;
/* OodleTex_Layout is an opaque structure that describes the block layout for a texture.

   Oodle Texture itself deals primarily with linear-layout
   2D images, because that is the most natural form to work in for BCn compression. However,
   actual textures are more complex objects and include mip chains, cube maps, texture arrays,
   and volume textures. As far as BCn compression is concerned, all of these things are made up
   of a collection of 2D images (not all with the same size), and there are various different
   ways of laying out the resulting collection of BCn blocks in memory.

   For some targets, especially game consoles, the native texture memory layouts are exposed in
   the SDK, and it is preferable to store textures in that form, since doing so minimizes
   load-time overhead.

   However, Oodle Texture RDO encoding is not independent of block ordering; for good results,
   the RDO encoder needs to know which order the blocks are going to be stored in memory (or on
   disk). Often this means reordering the blocks not just within a 2D image, but also between
   array/volume slices and sometimes even mipmap levels.

   Setting up an `OodleTex_Layout` allows the encoder to produce blocks in hardware memory order.

    $RateDistortionOptimization creates a BCN encoding such that it is smaller after Kraken compression.
    The smaller the after-compression result, the more error is introduced in the BCN encoding.  This quality vs
    size tradeoff is controlled by _rdo_lagrange_lambda_. This is the new entry point for the encoder with
    more encoder options.

    _rdo_lagrange_lambda_ is a scalar that provides fine control of the rate-quality balance.
    $OodleTex_RDOLagrangeLambda provides some example standard values.

    _rdo_lagrange_lambda_ = 0 means minimize distortion only, which produces the same encoding as $OodleTex_EncodeBCN_Blocks.
    As lambda gets higher, more effort is put into reducing rate at the cost of higher distortion.

    _options_ allows specifying more encoder options like the RDO effort level (controlling encoder speed).
    This is the major difference between this function and $OodleTex_EncodeBCN_RDO.

    Reads one or more surfaces _from_surfaces_ in _from_format_, writes _to_bcn_blocks_ in _to_bcn_ format.

    When _layout_ is NULL, the encoder produces blocks for all surfaces in row-major order.
    In that case, [num_blocks] must be the sum of $OodleTex_Surface_NumBlocks for all surfaces.
    Blocks for all surfaces are assumed to be consecutive.

    Specifying a _layout_ enables handling much more complicated scenarios such as interleaved hardware
    layouts for mip maps, texture arrays, cube maps or volume textures. Especially game consoles often
    expose the actual memory layout used by the hardware, which frequently interleaves data from multiple
    2D source images in complicated ways. When a _layout_ is specified, _num_blocks_ must match the number
    of blocks specified during $OodleTex_Layout_SetBlockLayout, and _num_from_surfaces_ must match the
    number of surfaces that make up said layout.

    _to_bcn_surface_ should be allocated to at least _num_blocks_ * $OodleTex_BC_BytesPerBlock.

    EncodeBCN_RDO will use multiple threads if a thread job system is installed via $OodleTex_Plugins_SetJobSystemAndCount.
    _num_job_threads_ should typically be set to $OODLETEX_JOBS_DEFAULT to use all workers installed, but a different
    number can be passed here to override what was set in SetJobSystemAndCount, or single-threaded execution
    on the current thread can be forced by passing $OODLETEX_JOBS_DISABLE.

    The layout describes how the blocks of a compressed BCn texture will be laid out in memory and is
    assumed to depend on the target texture format and the number and size of the individual surfaces,
    but not their contents. Texture layouts tell Oodle Texture how exactly the blocks in a given texture
    will be laid out in memory for a particular piece of target hardware.

    The list of _surfaces_ here should generally contain all the 2D surfaces that make up a complete
    texture object:

    $* For a regular 2D texture, this means the original image, and, if present, its mip maps, as one
    surface each, in no particular order.
    $* For a 2D texture array or cubemap, this means the base images for each element of the array
    (or face of the cubemap), plus all their mip maps, all as individual surfaces, and again
    in no particular order.
    $* For a 3D (volume) texture with a given depth _d_, you would usually pass _d_ surfaces, one per 2D slice
    through the texture.
    $* Finally a 3D texture with mip maps would have _d_ surfaces for the base mip level, max(_d_ / 2, 1) surfaces
    for the next-smaller mip level, and so forth.

    The order of surfaces in the surface array does not matter; use whatever is convenient or natural
    for you. The only important thing is that all 2D image surfaces that get combined and interleaved
    in some way into the final memory layout for the texture object on your target hardware should be present.

    Texture layout objects do not need to be created anew for every texture. The same texture layout object
    can be used multiple times if you are compressing many textures with the same dimensions and number
    of mip levels.

    After creating a texture layout object, the layout object exists but is not immediately usable
    for texture encoding just yet; first, you need to declare what the actual physical layout is.
    This is accomplished through a combination of $OodleTex_Layout_GenerateBlockIDs and
    $OodleTex_Layout_SetBlockLayout. See those functions for details.

    The way Oodle Texture tracks which blocks go where in the physical layout is by using a trick:
    for each of the 4x4 pixel blocks in the original texture, this function generates an ID that
    identifies both the surface it came from and the position inside the surface. These IDs are
    stored as a (generally meaningless to look at) texture in the compressed target format. This
    ID image, or a collection of several of them, can then be passed to utility functions that
    transform a linear-layout texture into the actual hardware format. Finally, you pass the result
    of this process back to Oodle Texture using $OodleTex_Layout_SetBlockLayout; since each of the block
    IDs was unique, this lets us figure out exactly where each block came from.

    In short, block_ids is (in effect) a 2D image in the format specified at layout creation time.
    For BC1 and BC4, individual blocks are 8 bytes each; the remaining formats all have 16-byte blocks.
    The image is ceil(width/4) blocks wide and ceil(height/4) blocks high, where the width
    and height are the width and height of the surface identified by surface_index specified
    at $OodleTex_Layout_Create time.

    Read the descriptions of $OodleTex_Layout_Create and $OodleTex_Layout_GenerateBlockIDs for
    an overview of the overall process.

    After creating 2D block ID images for every surface in the texture layout, you have the
    contents of all the pieces making up the full texture. The idea is to then pass these
    images to a texture tiling function that converts images from the original linear order
    to the actual memory layout used by the hardware; this may in turn depend on other flags
    not known to OodleTex_Layout such as tiling modes. It often also ends up interleaving
    data from several volume slices, array slices, or even mip levels.

    Oodle Texture does not know about the particulars of every console's texture tiling modes.
    Instead, by letting the console SDK itself do the tiling on a synthetic block ID texture,
    we can just look at the result and figure out where each block came from, which is all
    we really need to know to encode blocks in the right order.

    However, producing the final texture layout often adds some amount of padding bytes,
    especially between the smaller mip maps and for non-power-of-2 sizes. For this process
    to work right, you _need_ to make sure those padding bytes are initialized and set to 0.
    If in doubt, just clearing the output buffer to 0 before calling the texture tiling
    function(s) should do the job.

    This function checks the resulting layout to make sure all the block IDs are legal
    and make sense; if it does, the array of reordered block IDs is copied and stored
    as part of the OodleTex_Layout object.

    On success, the OodleTex_Layout is fully initialized and can now be used to encode
    textures with.

    $:return                per-pixel RMSE of the delta, normalized, less than zero for error

    Compute normalized RMSE of surfaces, aware of BCn compression.
    
    If you don't know how the surfaces were made, or how they should be interpreted, then
    just pass BC_Invalid for _was_bcn_.
    
    Note that we return RMSE per pixel, not per sample as many others do.
    This is because there is some ambiguity about counting the number of channels.
    
    "Normalized" means the two surfaces are converted to equal bit depth as UNORM/SNORM.
    For example, U8 and U16 pixels would be interpreted as 8-bit and 16-bit UNORM respectively,
    converted to the floating-point values they represent, and then the RMSE calculation
    is performed in that space.
    
    The returned RMSE is U8-scaled (same as if you did RMSE on byte images), which is to say,
    it's multiplied by 255 from the result of the RMSE calculation on floats. This is done purely
    because it makes typical error results for BCn formats conveniently scaled. RMSE values
    are calculated per pixel not per channel.
    
    For BC6, an HDR floating point metric is used, not linear RMSE.  This is also done if was_bcn is
    BC_Invalid and format1 and 2 are both floating point.
    
    "BCNAware" means on formats that ignore alpha (BC1 and BC7RGB), Alpha channel differences do
    not contribute to RMSE.  On formats that encode fewer channels (BC4,BC5) only the channels they encode are compared.

    If $OodleTex_BC_Invalid is passed, no BCN awareness is applied.  When "Invalid" is used, the RMSE
    is computed over the MIN of the channel count of the two surfaces.  For example, a BC7 surface compared
    to a 24-bit RGB image will get an RMSE over 3 channels with difference in the A channel ignored.

    If _was_bcn_ is passed, the channel count of the BCN will be used even if the surfaces do not
    contain them.  So if _was_bcn_ is BC7RGBA, a 4-channel difference (with A) is always computed, even if
    one of the surfaces is only 24-bit RGB (implicit A=255 is used there).  That is, passing "BC7RGBA"
    there instead of "BC7RGB" tells the RMSE you care about alpha preservation.
    
    This function can be used to RMSE block surfaces (instead of linear) if both _surf1_ and _surf2_
    are in block layout.

    Only pixels in the smaller of the two surfaces will be compared.  So if say one surface is not
    4x4 aligned, and the other is padded up to 4x4, then only the pixels in the original area will
    be compared.
    
    For _was_bcn_ == BC1_WithTransparency, alpha is converted to 0 or 255 at a 128 threshold for diffing.

    NOTE that _was_bcn_ is optional (pass OodleTex_BC_Invalid to disable it), and if you aren't sure what the right
    BCN to pass there is, it's better to pass Invalid.
    
    For example if you just have a BC7 file and you don't know if it was compressed for BC7RGB or BC7RGBA , then just pass
    BC_Invalid for _was_bcn_.
    
    The _was_bcn_ argument should be used when you specifically know how the BCN should be interpreted or how it
    was encoded and want to enable the special handling for that mode.
