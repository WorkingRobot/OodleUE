    If you want to ensure that Oodle is not doing any allocations, you can call OodleNet_Plugins_SetAllocators(NULL,NULL);
    If you do that, then any time Oodle needs to allocate memory internally, it will stop the process.
    It is STRONGLY not recommended that you ship that way.  You can verify that Oodle is not allocating, but then leave some
    fallback allocator installed when you actually ship just in case.

    Also note that on many consoles the standard allocation practices may not
    leave much heap memory for the C stdlib malloc.  In this case Oodle may fail to allocate.

    _target_parallelism_ allows you to tell Oodle how many Jobs it should try to keep in flight at once.
    Depending on the operation it may not be able to split work into this many jobs (so fewer will be used),
    but it will not exceed this count.

    For Oodle Data LZ work, typically _target_parallelism_ is usually best at the number of hardware cores
    not including hyper threads).

    For Oodle Texture BCN encoding work, _target_parallelism_ is usually best as the full number of hyper cores.

    In some cases you may wish to reduce _target_parallelism_ by 1 or 2 cores to leave some of the CPU free for
    other work.

    For example on a CPU with 16 cores and 32 hardware threads, for LZ work you might set _target_parallelism_ to 15
    when calling OodleCorePlugins.  For BC7 encoding you might set _target_parallelism_ to 30 when calling OodleTexPlugins.

    NOTE : if you are using Oodle Ext, do NOT call this.  OodleX_Init will install a job system for Oodle Core.
    Note OodleX only installs automatically to Oodle Core, not Net or Tex.  See example_jobify.cpp for manual

    Can be used with OodleNetwork1 UDP or TCP.
    
    The _dictionary_packet_pointers_ are used to fill the dictionary.  The _test_packet_pointers_
    are used to evaluate the quality of the dictionary.  They should not be the same packets!
    They should both be independent random representative samples of your network traffic.
    
    The packets used here should not be the same ones used for training!  (eg. with
    $OodleNetwork1UDP_Train or OodleNetwork1TCP_Train).
    
    This function is to be called before $OodleNetwork1_Shared_SetWindow.

    This function may take a lot of time if the _test_packet_pointers_ set is too large.  It should
    be large enough to provide good test ratings, but too large slows it down for no reason.
    Something like 50 MB of packet data is usually sufficient.

    See TestOodleNetwork1PacketCoder_SelectDictionaryAndTrain in $example_packet
    
    On platforms where $OodleNetwork1_SelectDictionarySupported returns false, this
    function is not supported.
    
    It's advised to run this function in 64-bit, as it can use a lot of memory.

    This function runs the packet selector of $OodleNetwork1_SelectDictionaryFromPackets
    repeatedly with some randomness.  Variation of packet selection can sometimes give
    slightly better dictionaries.
    
    The success of the trial is measured on the "test_packet" set.  Make sure that the
    "dictionary_packet" set are independently randomly drawn from the packet source data
    wrst the "test_packet" set so that over-training degeneracies are not created.
